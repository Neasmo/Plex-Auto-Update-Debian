The provided Bash script is designed to automate the periodic checking and updating process for Plex Media Server on a Debian-based system with ARM64 architecture. The script includes two main functions: update_plex and check_updates_periodically.

The update_plex function is responsible for stopping the Plex Media Server service, downloading the latest version of Plex Media Server tailored for ARM64 architecture from the official Plex website, installing the new version using dpkg, restarting the Plex service, and finally, removing the temporary package file.

The core functionality is expanded with the addition of the check_updates_periodically function. This function utilizes a perpetual loop (while true) to perform periodic checks for updates. Within each iteration of the loop, the script echoes a message indicating that it is checking for updates. It then retrieves the latest Plex version available from the Plex website and compares it with the currently installed version. If a newer version is detected, the script triggers the update_plex function to execute the update process. Otherwise, it notifies that no update is available and waits for 24 hours before initiating the next check.

This periodic update-checking mechanism ensures that the Plex Media Server is regularly inspected for newer releases, automating the update process and allowing users to stay current with the latest features and improvements without manual intervention. Users can adjust the duration of the waiting period between checks by modifying the sleep parameter within the script.
