The provided Bash script automates the update process for Plex Media Server on a Debian-based system with ARM64 architecture. The script begins by defining a variable PLEX_PATH to store the path to the Plex Media Server directory, set to "/usr/lib/plexmediaserver". Following this, a function named update_plex() is defined to encapsulate the update process. Within this function:

The Plex Media Server service is stopped using sudo service plexmediaserver stop.
The latest version of Plex Media Server for ARM64 architecture is downloaded from the Plex website using the wget command.
The new version is installed with sudo dpkg -i plex.deb.
The Plex Media Server service is restarted with sudo service plexmediaserver start.
The temporary package file is removed to maintain a clean working directory.
Finally, the script calls the update_plex function, initiating the Plex update process. This script streamlines the update procedure, providing a convenient and automated way to keep Plex Media Server up-to-date on the specified system. Users should ensure proper execution permissions (e.g., chmod +x script.sh) before running the script.
